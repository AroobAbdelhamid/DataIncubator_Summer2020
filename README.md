# DataIncubator_Summer2020
For my project, I am using climate change precipitation changes (as a proxy for flooding/hurricanes) to predict future housing/commercial real estate prices in the continental U.S. While climate change is already established, humans have done a poor job so far adapting to the new changes. The future of our economy is dependent on climate change and its effects on the United States geography, including from hurricanes, flooding, and other extreme weather events and it would benefit businesses greatly if they were aware of the places best suited to build businesses/headquarters, where new hubs are likely to be centered in the future and where forward-thinking businesses will begin focusing on now. To do this, I plan to use either Random Forests or Matrix Factorization to distinguish the role of precipitation in determining the cost of an area and use that along with expected future temperature to predict housing prices in the future. By placing these expected costs on an average precipitation map of the US (by season), companies can gain a better understanding of where the future of their business is.
